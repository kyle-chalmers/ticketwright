# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); this project uses semantic-ish versioning.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-06-30

`pip install ticketwright`.

### Added
- **PyPI distribution** via GitHub Trusted Publishing (OIDC, no tokens) — `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
  fires on a `v*` tag, builds with `uv`, verifies tag == version, uploads via `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`.
- **`ticketwright` CLI** (zero runtime deps, stdlib-only): `init` scaffolds the kit into a repo (a
  versioned, upgrade-safe `cp -r` that preserves existing per-repo config), and `recall` / `index` /
  `enrich` run the bundled tools against `$PWD` standalone (no Claude Code needed).
- The kit assets are bundled into the wheel under `ticketwright/_kit/` via hatchling `force-include`,
  so the Claude Code **plugin** and `cp -r` paths (which reference `bin/` at the repo root) are unchanged.
- Setup + release flow documented in [`docs/pypi-setup.md`](docs/pypi-setup.md).

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-28

Fold the best of the earlier `crank-tickets`/GDD experiment into Ticketwright (now the canonical line),
and make it installable as a Claude Code plugin.

### Added
- **Role-mode templates** (`templates/roles/{generalist,analyst,engineer,scientist}.md`) — `configure-workspace`
  asks the team's persona, stores `project.role`, and fills a `{{role_focus}}` block in the rendered
  `AGENTS.md` so the rules emphasize that role's deliverables + QC focus.
- **`ROADMAP.md`** — versioned plan; next up is plugin packaging + the tracker `id_mode` contract.
- **Self-test §14/§15 — scrub + structure + manifest**: generic secret/PII scan, every command/skill
  has a `description`, every adapter declares `seam` + `tool`, plugin manifest valid + symlinks resolve
  + declared hook scripts present (runs in CI). Self-test now 79 checks.
- **Plugin packaging** — Ticketwright is now an installable **Claude Code plugin**
  (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `marketplace.json`): `claude plugin install ticketwright@ticketwright`
  instead of `cp -r`. Components auto-discover via top-level `commands`/`skills`/`agents` symlinks into
  `.claude/` (the loader rejects custom `.claude/` paths in the manifest); hooks are declared in the
  manifest with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`; bin/ scripts are referenced dual-mode
  (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/bin/…`) so the vendored `cp -r` install still works
  unchanged. Plugin commands are namespaced (`/ticketwright:recall`); per-repo config still via
  `/configure-workspace`. Validated end-to-end with `claude plugin validate` + install + `details`.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-27

Sharpen recall and make the index observable — informed by dogfooding against a 139-ticket archive and
a two-AI (Codex + agent panel) improvement review. Everything stays stdlib-only and tool-agnostic.

### Added
- **`recall.py --eval [--sweep]`** — read-only recall-quality diagnostic: holds out each ticket's curated
  cross-refs and reports MRR / P@1 / P@3 / recall@5 (the cross-ref signal is excluded from scoring to
  avoid label leakage). Never auto-tunes; the `4/3/5/1` weights stay hand-set. `--sweep` shows weight
  sensitivity for a human to read.
- **IDF object down-weighting** in recall scoring — a ubiquitous object (e.g. one touched by 55 tickets)
  contributes less than a rare shared one. Discount-only (floor 0.4), tuned via `--eval` to a strict
  Pareto gain (MRR .550→.571, P@1 .408→.421, P@3 .618→.671, recall@5 .462→.494). Flat `W_OBJECT` stays
  the ceiling, so the transparent-weights stance holds.
- **Advisory verdict line + `--min-score`** on recall — a scale-free "strong / clear-leader / weak /
  none" read so PLAN can decide whether to open candidates (advisory, never an auto-skip).
- **`build_ticket_index.py --recurring [--min-tickets N]`** — ranks objects touched by many tickets over
  a long date span; surfaces productize candidates (feeds the productize-workflow loop).
- **`build_ticket_index.py --stats` health metrics** — enrichment %, median summary length,
  under-enriched count (no tags+objects), one-off vs shared object counts, oldest stale ticket.
- **Scale-aware `OBJECTS.md`** — above ~150 distinct objects, single-ticket objects collapse into a
  compact appendix so the shared-object table stays scannable (full data preserved).

### Changed
- **Ingest is now the validation trust boundary** — `ingest_index_records.py` drops malformed dates,
  filters bare (dot-less) object names, and coerces tags to kebab-case (deduped, capped). Both the enrich
  path and the build-ticket-index skill funnel through it, so one guard covers both.
- Self-test grows to 71 checks (IDF ranking, `--eval` smoke, `--recurring`, ingest validators).

### Removed
- Plural-folding in the recall tokenizer (it had been prototyped) — `--eval` showed it regresses P@1/MRR,
  so it was dropped rather than shipped. (The harness earning its keep by killing a feature.)

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-27

Make the ticket index *active*.

### Added
- **Prior-art recall** — `bin/recall.py` ranks prior tickets against a seed/query by a transparent
  lexical score (object ×4, tag ×3, cross-ref +5, keyword ×1; recency tiebreak), exposed as the
  `/recall` command and auto-wired into `/prime-ticket` + `spec-and-build` so reuse surfaces in PLAN.
  Lexical + stdlib (no embeddings); rank → read-top-K scales past the index's context limit.
- **Object reverse-index** — `tickets/OBJECTS.md` (object → tickets), with each ticket's `objects`
  from enrichment ∪ a keyword-anchored grep of its SQL. `/recall --object VW_X` for live lookup.
- **Deep QC** — `qc-review --deep` spawns an adversarial panel (one reviewer per pyramid layer) and
  verifies every finding against the deliverable before it counts, then synthesizes one verdict.

### Changed
- The `PostToolUse` hook and `--check` gate now keep `OBJECTS.md` in sync alongside `INDEX.md`.
- Self-test grows to 67 checks (recall ranking, reverse lookup + leaf match, OBJECTS.md render + gate,
  Python-import exclusion, multi-owner seed disambiguation, privacy guard).

### Security
- The ticket-index store (`tickets/index_data.json`) is **per-install private business data**, so it is
  now gitignored in the kit itself — a real store can't be committed upstream by accident. The schema is
  shipped as `tickets/index_data.example.json` (fixture ids only), and self-test §12 fails if a tracked
  store ever carries non-fixture (`ENG-`/`DEMO-`/`TEST-`/`SAMPLE-`) ticket ids.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-25

Initial public release.

### Added
- **AI layer**: 9 skills (configure-workspace, onboard-teammate, start-ticket,
  spec-and-build, qc-review, deliver-ticket, productize-workflow, build-context-pack,
  build-ticket-index), 3 prime commands, and a `qc-reviewer` sub-agent — the PIV loop
  (Plan → Implement → Validate) made explicit.
- **Tool-agnostic config + adapters**: one `stack.yaml` maps five seams (tracker, warehouse,
  chat, docstore, vcs) to concrete tools via 19 thin per-tool adapters; skills never name a tool.
  Trackers: Jira, Azure DevOps, Linear, Asana, Monday, GitHub Issues. Warehouses: Snowflake,
  BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, Redshift, Synapse/Azure SQL. Three worked configs ship
  (Jira/Snowflake/Slack/Drive/GitHub, Asana/BigQuery/Teams/SharePoint/GitLab, and
  Azure DevOps/Synapse/Teams/SharePoint/Azure Repos).
- **Policy enforcement hooks** (Claude Code): `db_write_guard` (mechanical approval before
  destructive warehouse statements), `session_context` (session priming), `ticket_index_context`
  (SessionStart catalog surfacing), `regenerate_ticket_index` (PostToolUse auto-regen).
- **Self-maintaining ticket index**: `tickets/INDEX.md` — a deterministic, byte-stable renderer
  (`bin/build_ticket_index.py`, `--check` gate) over a model-authored store (`tickets/index_data.json`),
  surfaced at session start and auto-regenerated on ticket-folder changes via hooks; curated at
  ticket close (`bin/enrich_ticket.py` / the `build-ticket-index` skill).
- **Templates** (AGENTS.md, ticket README, plan, spec, productized-skill skeleton) and a kit
  **self-test** (`bin/selftest.sh`) covering config parsing, adapter verb coverage, tool-name
  isolation, frontmatter validity, token rendering, and hook unit tests.
